# Fall-Detection-for-Elderly-People
ðŸ§“ Fall Detection System Using Machine Learning
This project implements a machine learning-based fall detection system aimed at monitoring elderly individuals using wearable sensor data such as accelerometers and gyroscopes. By accurately distinguishing between fall and non-fall activities, the system enables timely alerts to caregivers or family members, promoting faster response and increased safety.

ðŸ©º Project Goals
Detect falls in real-time using motion sensor data

Reduce false alarms by accurately classifying human activities

Enable early intervention through automated alerting

Support elderly care through intelligent monitoring systems

ðŸ“Š Dataset
Dataset Used: SisFall Dataset

Includes various human activities: falls, walking, sitting, lying down, etc.

Collected from 23 subjects with accelerometer and gyroscope readings

ðŸ§  Machine Learning Models
Decision Tree: Achieved ~96% accuracy

Support Vector Machine (SVM): Used for comparison

Feature Engineering: Extracted time-domain and statistical features (mean, std, energy, etc.)

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
